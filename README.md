# Car_Price_Prediction_Project
### Business Goal
You are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy, etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

The problem is solved with the OLS regression model, REF, VIF, and P values.
(To clarify: OLS= Ordinary Least Square, RFE = Recursive Feature elimination, VIF= Variance Inflation Factor)
